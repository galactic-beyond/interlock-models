MADs: Model Analysis Documents
==============================

MADs are short documents that analyze the Interlock Model.
They are numbered sequentially, and are referred to via their number.
The numbers are immutable, for reference-stability.

Each MAD should focus on a single theme or single relation, and the
implications of that relation (i.e. relation between reward-rate and
airlock-adoption).

Each MAD should describe changes that have been made to the model,
since the _previous_ MAD was written.

Each MAD should -- if appropriate -- close with a list of unanswered
questions that follow from the preceding content. Such questions can
be about existing model mechanics, or questions about how specific
model-changes would or could change the preceding content.

In principle, someone should be able to read all the MADs to understand
which assumptions act as the foundation of which decisions.

Never write a MAD that lacks diagrams.
